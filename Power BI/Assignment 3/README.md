# 2. What limitations of Excel, Microsoft solved by PowerBi?

While Microsoft Excel is a powerful tool for working with data, it has some limitations that Power BI solves. Here are some of the main limitations of Excel that Power BI solves:

1. Large Data Volumes: Excel can handle large amounts of data, but as data volumes grow, Excel can become slow and difficult to manage. Power BI is designed to handle much larger data sets and can process and analyze data more efficiently.

2. Data Integration: In Excel, it can be challenging to bring together data from different sources and integrate it into a single report or analysis. Power BI includes built-in connectors to many different data sources, making it easier to integrate data from a variety of sources.

3. Data Visualization: While Excel can create basic charts and graphs, Power BI is designed for more sophisticated data visualization. Power BI provides a wide range of visualization options and allows users to create interactive dashboards and reports that are easy to understand and analyze.

4. Collaboration: Sharing Excel files with others can be challenging, especially if multiple people need to work on the same file at the same time. Power BI makes it easy to share reports and dashboards with others, and includes built-in collaboration features that allow multiple people to work on the same report or dashboard at the same time.

5. Real-time Data: Excel is not designed for real-time data processing and analysis, which can be a limitation in certain industries such as finance and manufacturing. Power BI is designed to handle real-time data processing and analysis, allowing users to monitor data in real-time and make data-driven decisions faster.


# 3. Explain PowerQuery?

Power Query is a data transformation and preparation tool that is built into Microsoft Excel and Power BI. It allows users to connect to and import data from a wide range of sources, transform and shape the data as needed, and load it into Excel or Power BI for further analysis.

Here are some of the key features of Power Query:

1. Data Connectivity: Power Query includes connectors to a wide range of data sources, including databases, Excel files, CSV files, web pages, and many more. This makes it easy to connect to and import data from virtually any source.

2. Data Transformation: Power Query provides a wide range of transformation options, including filtering, sorting, merging, grouping, pivoting, and many more. This allows users to transform and shape the data as needed to prepare it for analysis.

3. User-Friendly Interface: Power Query has a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to perform complex data transformations without the need for complex coding or programming.

4. Reusable Queries: Power Query allows users to create reusable queries that can be used across multiple workbooks or reports. This makes it easy to standardize data transformation processes across an organization.

5. Automatic Updates: Power Query includes automatic updates, which means that if the source data changes, the Power Query data will automatically update as well.


# 4. Explain PowerMap?

Power Map is a 3D data visualization tool that is part of the Microsoft Power BI suite. It allows users to create interactive maps and geospatial visualizations from Excel data. Power Map can be used to visualize data such as sales by region, customer demographics, or any other data that is location-based.

Here are some of the key features of Power Map:

1. Interactive Maps: Power Map allows users to create interactive maps that can be zoomed, panned, and rotated to explore data in 3D.

2. Custom Visualizations: Power Map includes a range of custom visualizations that can be used to highlight data in different ways, including heat maps, bar charts, and bubble charts.

3. Time-Based Animations: Power Map allows users to create time-based animations that show how data changes over time. This can be useful for visualizing trends or changes in data over a specific period.

4. Integration with Power BI: Power Map can be integrated with other Power BI tools, such as Power Query and Power Pivot, to create more sophisticated data visualizations and analyses.

5. Shareable Dashboards: Power Map visualizations can be embedded in Excel or shared as a dashboard in Power BI. This allows users to share their data visualizations with others in their organization or with external stakeholders.


# 5. How PowerBi eliminated the need to host SharePoint Server on premises?

Power BI eliminates the need to host SharePoint Server on premises by providing a cloud-based solution for sharing and collaborating on reports and dashboards. With Power BI, users can easily create, share, and view reports and dashboards from anywhere, without the need for an on-premises SharePoint Server.

Here are some of the ways that Power BI eliminates the need for SharePoint Server:

1. Cloud-Based Storage: Power BI stores reports and dashboards in the cloud, which eliminates the need for on-premises storage and hosting.

2. Easy Sharing: Power BI makes it easy to share reports and dashboards with others in your organization or with external stakeholders. Users can share reports via email or embed them in other applications such as Microsoft Teams.

3. Collaborative Workspaces: Power BI provides collaborative workspaces where teams can work together on reports and dashboards. This allows for real-time collaboration and feedback, without the need for an on-premises SharePoint Server.

4. Access Control: Power BI provides robust access control features, allowing users to control who can view, edit, or share reports and dashboards. This provides a level of security and control that is similar to what is provided by an on-premises SharePoint Server.

5. Mobile Access: Power BI provides mobile access to reports and dashboards, allowing users to view and interact with data on their mobile devices. This provides greater flexibility and accessibility compared to an on-premises SharePoint Server.
