# 1. What do you mean by BI? Explain.

BI typically stands for Business Intelligence. It is a term used to describe technologies, processes, and practices that organizations use to collect, integrate, analyze, and present business information to support decision-making.

In other words, BI is a way for businesses to make sense of large amounts of data they collect by turning that data into useful insights that can inform decisions, improve operations, and create value.

Business Intelligence encompasses a range of techniques and tools, including data mining, data warehousing, dashboards, and reporting, among others. BI solutions can be used in many different areas of a business, including finance, marketing, sales, human resources, and operations.

Overall, BI provides organizations with a better understanding of their performance, customers, and markets, which can help them make informed decisions, identify areas for improvement, and ultimately achieve their goals more effectively.



# 2. How Power-BI helps in BI, and how does it help Analysts? Explain.

Power BI is a powerful business intelligence tool developed by Microsoft that helps organizations and analysts to visualize and analyze their data effectively. Here are some ways that Power BI can help in BI and benefit analysts:

Data Integration: Power BI can connect to a wide range of data sources, including spreadsheets, databases, cloud-based services, and web applications. This makes it easy for analysts to integrate data from multiple sources and create a single view of their data.

Data Modeling: Power BI provides robust data modeling capabilities, allowing analysts to transform and shape their data to meet their specific requirements. Analysts can create relationships between different data tables, define hierarchies, and add calculated columns or measures to enrich their data.

Data Visualization: Power BI provides a rich set of visualization options, including charts, graphs, maps, and tables, that help analysts to explore and communicate their data insights effectively. Analysts can also create custom visualizations using the Power BI developer tools.

Collaboration: Power BI enables analysts to collaborate with other team members by sharing their reports and dashboards in real-time. This helps to ensure that everyone is working with the same data and insights.

AI Capabilities: Power BI provides AI-powered features such as natural language processing (NLP), which enables users to ask questions in plain language and receive relevant visualizations. Analysts can also use the AI-powered forecasting capabilities to predict future trends and make data-driven decisions.

In summary, Power BI helps analysts in BI by providing them with powerful data integration, modeling, visualization, collaboration, and AI capabilities that enable them to analyze and communicate their data insights effectively. It saves time, streamlines the process, and allows analysts to focus on the more critical aspects of their work.

# 3. Explain Descriptive analytics?

Descriptive analytics help answer questions about what has happened based on historical data. Descriptive analytics techniques summarize large datasets to describe outcomes to stakeholders.

By developing key performance indicators (KPIs), these strategies can help track the success or failure of key objectives. Metrics such as return on investment (ROI) are used in many industries, and specialized metrics are developed to track performance in specific industries.

An example of descriptive analytics is generating reports to provide a view of an organization's sales and financial data.


# 4. Explain Predictive analytics?

Predictive analytics help answer questions about what will happen in the future. Predictive analytics techniques use historical data to identify trends and determine if they're likely to recur. Predictive analytical tools provide valuable insight into what might happen in the future. Techniques include a variety of statistical and machine learning techniques such as neural networks, decision trees, and regression.


# 5. Explain Prescriptive analytics?

Prescriptive analytics help answer questions about which actions should be taken to achieve a goal or target. By using insights from prescriptive analytics, organizations can make data-driven decisions. This technique allows businesses to make informed decisions in the face of uncertainty. Prescriptive analytics techniques rely on machine learning as one of the strategies to find patterns in large datasets. By analyzing past decisions and events, organizations can estimate the likelihood of different outcomes.


# 6. Write five real-life questions that PowerBi can solve.

+ What are our sales trends across different regions and product categories? Power BI can help answer this question by pulling in sales data from various sources, creating interactive visualizations, and providing insights into which regions and products are performing well.

+ How are our marketing campaigns performing? Power BI can help track key marketing metrics such as website traffic, leads generated, and conversion rates, and provide insights into which campaigns are driving the most engagement and ROI.

+ How can we improve our customer retention? Power BI can help analyze customer data, including demographics, purchase history, and feedback, to identify patterns and trends that can inform strategies to improve customer retention and loyalty.

+ What are the key drivers of employee satisfaction and engagement? Power BI can help analyze employee data, such as feedback surveys and performance metrics, to identify factors that impact employee satisfaction and engagement and inform strategies to improve employee morale and productivity.

+ How can we optimize our supply chain operations? Power BI can help track inventory levels, supplier performance, shipping times, and other key supply chain metrics to identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and areas for improvement. This can help reduce costs, increase efficiency, and improve customer satisfaction.
