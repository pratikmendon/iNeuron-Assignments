# 2. If you set a row height or column width to 0 (zero), what happens to the row and column?

If you set a row height or column width to 0 (zero), the row or column will become hidden, and it will not be visible in the worksheet. This means that you won't be able to see the content of the cells in that row or column.

However, the data in the hidden row or column will still exist in the worksheet, and you can unhide it later if you need to. To unhide a row or column, you can select the rows or columns on either side of the hidden one, right-click, and then select "Unhide" from the context menu.


# 3. Is there a need to change the height and width in a cell? Why?

Yes, there is a need to change the height and width in a cell in some situations. Here are a few reasons why you might need to adjust the height and width of a cell:

+ To fit the content: If the content of a cell is too long or too wide, you may need to adjust the height or width of the cell to ensure that all the content is visible. This can make the data in your worksheet easier to read and understand.

+ To improve readability: If you have a lot of data in your worksheet, adjusting the height and width of the cells can help improve readability. For example, increasing the row height can make it easier to distinguish one row from another, while increasing the column width can make it easier to read the content of each cell.

+ To make the worksheet look more professional: Adjusting the height and width of cells can also help make your worksheet look more professional. By ensuring that all the data is neatly aligned and properly spaced, you can make the worksheet more appealing to the eye.
